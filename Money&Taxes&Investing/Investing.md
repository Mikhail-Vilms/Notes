## I. Individual Stocks

### Financial statements to look at:
- I. Balance sheet
- II. Income Statement
- III. Cash Flow Statement
- IV. Footnotes

#### I. Balance Sheet
- Assets:
  - Cash and Cash Equivalents (CCE): reports the value of a company's assets that are cash or can be converted into cash immediately. Cash equivalents include bank accounts and marketable securities, which are debt securities with maturities of less than 90 days.
  - Accounts Receivable (AR): is the balance of money due to a firm for goods or services delivered or used but not yet paid for by customers. Accounts receivables are listed on the balance sheet as a current asset. AR is any amount of money owed by customers for purchases made on credit.
  - Inventory
- Liabilities:
  - Current Liabilities: Current liabilities are a company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or within a normal operating cycle. An operating cycle, also referred to as the cash conversion cycle, is the time it takes a company to purchase inventory and convert it to cash from sales. An example of a current liability is money owed to suppliers in the form of accounts payable. Current liabilities are typically settled using current assets, which are assets that are used up within one year.
    - Accounts payable
    - Short-term debt such as bank loans or commercial paper issued to fund operations
    - Dividends payable
    - Notes payable—the principal portion of outstanding debt
    - Current portion of deferred revenue, such as prepayments by customers for work not completed or earned yet
    - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt (CPLTD): Current liabilities are a company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or within a normal operating cycle. The CPLTD is separated out on the company's balance sheet because it needs to be paid by highly liquid assets, such as cash. The CPLTD is an important tool for creditors and investors to use to identify if a company has the ability to pay off its short-term obligations as they come due.
  - 
- Shareholders' Equity: Shareholders' equity is a company's total assets minus its total liabilities. Shareholders' equity represents the amount of money that would be returned to shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the company's debt was paid off.


Accounting Equation (Balance Sheet Equation):
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity

## III. ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)
Like mutual funds, ETFs offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund that makes investments in stocks, bonds, or other assets and, in return, to receive an interest in that investment pool.  Unlike mutual funds, however, ETF shares are traded on a national stock exchange and at market prices that may or may not be the same as the net asset value (“NAV”) of the shares, that is, the value of the ETF’s assets minus its liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.

## IV. Index Funds
Index Fund - An investment that attempts to track the performance of a specific index (sometimes referred to as a "benchmark")—like the popular S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite Index, or Dow Jones Industrial Average. A mutual fund or an ETF buys all or a representative sample of the bonds or stocks in the index that the fund tracks.
