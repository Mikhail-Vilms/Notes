## Balance Sheet

### [Current Assets](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/in/resources/accountants-and-bookkeepers-accountants-and-bookkeepers/what-are-current-assets/)
Short-term economic resources that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. Current assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and various prepaid expenses
- **Cash And Cash Equivalents (CCE)**
- **Accounts Receivable**: Refers to money that customers owe the company, perhaps including an allowance for doubtful accounts since a certain proportion of customers can be expected not to pay.
- **Stock or Inventory**: Is goods available for sale, valued at the lower of the cost or market price. 
- **Marketable Securities**: Marketable securities are the investments made by the company. These investments are both easily marketable as well as expected to be converted into cash within a year. These include treasury bills, notes, bonds and equity securities.
- **Prepaid Expense (Prepayments)**: Represent the value that has already been paid for, such as insurance, advertising contracts or rent.



### Non-current Assets
(Long-term Assets)
#### PPE
[Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/ppe-property-plant-equipment/) basically includes any of a company’s long-term, fixed assets. PP&E assets are tangible, identifiable, and expected to generate an economic return for the company for more than one year or one operating cycle (whichever is longer). The account can include machinery, equipment, vehicles, buildings, land, office equipment, and furnishings, among other things. Note that, of all these asset classes, land is one of the only assets that does not depreciate over time. If a company produces machinery (for sale), that machinery is not classified as property, plant, and equipment, but rather is classified as inventory. The same goes for real estate companies that hold buildings and land under their assets. Their office buildings and land are PP&E, but the houses or land they sell are inventory.

#### Goodwill
- Goodwill is an intangible asset that is associated with the purchase of one company by another. Specifically, goodwill is the portion of the purchase price that is higher than the sum of the net fair value of all of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process. The value of a company’s brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations, and proprietary technology represent some reasons why goodwill exists.
- Goodwill is an intangible asset that accounts for the excess purchase price of another company.
- The value of goodwill typically arises in an acquisition—when an acquirer purchases a target company. The amount the acquiring company pays for the target company over the target’s net assets at fair value usually accounts for the value of the target’s goodwill If the acquiring company pays less than the target’s book value, it gains negative goodwill, meaning that it purchased the company at a bargain in a distress sale.

#### Intangible Assets
- An intangible asset is an asset that is not physical in nature.
- Examples: **** Goodwill, brand recognition and intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights**.
- An intangible asset can be classified as either indefinite or definite. A company's brand name is considered an indefinite intangible asset because it stays with the company for as long as it continues operations. An example of a definite intangible asset would be a legal agreement to operate under another company's patent, with no plans of extending the agreement. The agreement thus has a limited life and is classified as a definite asset.
- Businesses can create or acquire intangible assets. For example, a business may create a mailing list of clients or establish a patent. If a business creates an intangible asset, it can write off the expenses from the process, such as filing the patent application, hiring a lawyer, and paying other related costs.
- In addition, all the expenses along the way of creating the intangible asset are expensed. However, intangible assets created by a company do not appear on the balance sheet and have no recorded book value. Because of this, when a company is purchased, often the purchase price is above the book value of assets on the balance sheet. The purchasing company records the premium paid as an intangible asset on its balance sheet.

### Current Liabilities

#### Accounts Payables
Amounts owed by the company to the suppliers

#### Accrued Expenses
Expences that have not been incurred but not yet paid

### Non-Current Liabilities
A [Non-Current Liabilities](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/non-current-liability/) (Long-term Liabilities) (Long-term Debts)]  refers to the financial obligations in a company’s balance sheet that are not expected to be paid within one year. Non-current liabilities are due in the long term, compared to short-term liabilities, which are due within one year.

#### Credit Lines
A credit line is an arrangement between a lender and a borrower, where the lender makes a specific amount of funds available for the business when needed. Instead of getting lump-sum credit, the business draws a specific amount of credit when needed up to the credit limit allowed by the lender.

A credit line is usually valid for a specified period of time when the business can draw the funds. If a business draws funds to purchase industrial equipment, the credit will be classified as a non-current liability.

#### Long-term Lease
Lease payments are common expenditures that companies are required to meet to fulfill their purchase commitments. Companies use capital leases to finance the purchase of fixed assets, such as industrial equipment and motor vehicles.

If the lease term exceeds one year, the lease payments made towards the capital lease are treated as non-current liabilities since they reduce the long-term obligations of the lease. The property purchased using the capital lease is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.

#### Bonds Payable
A bond is a long-term lending arrangement between a lender and a borrower, and it is used as a means of financing capital projects. Bonds are issued through an investment bank, and they are classified as long-term liabilities if the payment period exceeds one year. The borrower must make interest payments at fixed amounts over an agreed period of time, usually more than one year.

#### Notes Payable
A note, also called a promissory note, is a special type of loan arrangement where a borrower makes an unconditional promise to pay back the principal plus interest to the lender. The promissory note is used to finance the purchase of assets such as machinery and buildings. If the maturity period of the note exceeds one year, it is considered a non-current asset.

#### Deferred Tax Liabilities
Deferred tax liabilities refer to the amount of taxes that a company has not paid in the current period, and that are required to be paid in the future. The liability is calculated by finding the difference between the accrued tax and the taxes payable. Therefore, the company will be required to pay more tax in the future due to a transaction that occurred in the current period for which tax has not been remitted.

### Shareholder Equity
- For corporations, shareholder equity (SE), also referred to as shareholders' equity and stockholders' equity, is the corporation's owners' residual claim on assets after debts have been paid. Equity is equal to a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities.
- Retained earnings is part of shareholder equity and is the percentage of net earnings that were not paid to shareholders as dividends. Retained earnings should not be confused with cash or other liquid assets. This is because years of retained earnings could be used for either expenses or any asset type to grow the business. Shareholders’ equity for a company that is a going concern is not the same as liquidation value. In liquidation, physical asset values have been reduced and other extraordinary conditions exist.

#### Share Capital
(Shareholders’ Capital, Equity Capital, Contributed Capital, or Paid-in Capital)
- This is the value of funds that shareholders have invested in the company. When a company is first formed, shareholders will typically put in cash. For example, an investor starts a company and seeds it with $10M. Cash (an asset) rises by $10M, and Share Capital (an equity account) rises by $10M, balancing out the balance sheet.
- Through the fundamental equation where assets equal liabilities plus equity, we can see that assets must be funded through one of the two. One method for a company to fund its assets is to create liabilities (borrow money or issue debt) and, therefore, create obligations that must be paid back. The other option is to issue equity through common shares or preferred shares. In exchange for an ownership interest claim to the company, the company receives cash from investors and shareholders.
- 
#### Retained Earnings
- This is the total amount of net income the company decides to keep. Every period, a company may pay out dividends from its net income. Any amount remaining (or exceeding) is added to (deducted from) retained earnings.

## Income Statement
- The [Income Statement](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/income-statement/) (Statement of Operations) (Statement of Profit and Loss) (P&L) is one of a company’s core financial statements that shows their profit and loss over a period of time. The profit or loss is determined by taking all revenues and subtracting all expenses from both operating and non-operating activities.
- Though the main purpose of an income statement is to convey details of profitability and business activities of the company to the stakeholders, it also provides detailed insights into the company’s internals for comparison across different businesses and sectors. Such statements are also prepared more frequently at the department- and segment-levels to gain deeper insights by the company management for checking the progress of various operations throughout the year, though such interim reports may remain internal to the company.
- Based on income statements, management can make decisions like expanding to new geographies, pushing sales, increasing production capacity, increased utilization or outright sale of assets, or shutting down a department or product line. Competitors may also use them to gain insights about the success parameters of a company and focus areas as increasing R&D spends.
- Creditors may find limited use of income statements as they are more concerned about a company’s future cash flows, instead of its past profitability. Research analysts use the income statement to compare year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter performance. One can infer whether a company's efforts in reducing the cost of sales helped it improve profits over time, or whether the management managed to keep a tab on operating expenses without compromising on profitability.
- An income statement provides valuable insights into various aspects of a business. It includes a company’s operations, the efficiency of its management, the possible leaky areas that may be eroding profits, and whether the company is performing in line with industry peers.

### Sales
- [Sales](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/sales-revenue/) (Revenue) (Turnover) is the company’s revenue from sales or services, displayed at the very top of the statement
- This value will be the gross of the costs associated with creating the goods sold or in providing services
- Some companies have multiple revenue streams that add to a total revenue line.
- It is important to note that revenue does not necessarily mean cash received. A portion of sales revenue may be paid in cash and a portion may be paid on credit, through such means as accounts receivables.

#### Operating Revenue
- [Operating Revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-revenue.asp) is the revenue that a company generates from its primary business activities.
- Distinguishing operating revenue from total revenue is important because it provides valuable information about the productivity and profitability of a company's primary business operations. 
- Despite the fact that operating revenue is recorded separately on financial statements, some firms may attempt to mask decreases in operating revenue by combining it with non-operating revenue. Understanding and identifying the sources of revenue is helpful in assessing the health of a firm and its operations. 
#### Non-Operating Revenue
- Revenues realized through secondary, non-core business activities are often referred to as non-operating recurring revenues. These revenues are sourced from the earnings which are outside of the purchase and sale of goods and services and may include income from interest earned on business capital lying in the bank, rental income from business property, income from strategic partnerships like royalty payment receipts or income from an advertisement display placed on business property.
#### Gains
- Also called other income, gains indicate the net money made from other activities, like the sale of long-term assets. These include the net income realized from one-time non-business activities, like a company selling its old transportation van, unused land, or a subsidiary company.

### Cost of Goods Sold
- [Cost of Goods Sold](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/cost-of-goods-sold-cogs/) (COGS) (Direct Operating Cost) (Cost of Sales) measures the “direct cost” incurred in the production of any goods or services. It includes material cost, direct labor cost, and direct factory overheads, and is directly proportional to revenue.
- Cost of goods sold consists of all the costs associated with producing the goods or providing the services offered by the company. For goods, these costs may include the variable costs involved in manufacturing products, such as raw materials and labor.
- They may also include fixed costs, such as factory overhead, storage costs, and depending on the relevant accounting policies, sometimes depreciation expense.
- The basic purpose of finding COGS is to calculate the “true cost” of merchandise sold in the period. It doesn’t reflect the cost of goods that are purchased in the period and not being sold or just kept in inventory. It helps management and investors monitor the performance of the business.

### Gross Profit
- The Gross Profit (GP) of a business is the accounting result obtained after deducting the cost of goods sold and sales returns/allowances from total sales revenue.  GP is located on the income statement (sometimes referred to as the statement of profit and loss) produced by a company and is used in determining a company’s gross margin.
- The formula for calculating gross margin is: **Gross Margin** = Gross Profit / Total Revenue x 100

### SG&A
- [Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expense](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/what-is-sga/) includes all non-production expenses incurred by a company in any given period. It includes expenses such as rent, advertising, marketing, accounting, litigation, travel, meals, management salaries, bonuses, and more. On occasion, it may also include depreciation expense, depending on what it’s related to.

#### Selling Expenses
- The selling component of this expense line is related to the direct and indirect costs of generating revenue (from selling products or services).
- Direct expenses are those incurred at the exact point-of-sale for a product or service.  Examples of direct selling expenses include transaction costs and commissions paid on a sale.
- Indirect selling expenses are incurred either before or after the sale is made, and examples include salaries, benefits, and wages for salespeople, travel, and accommodation expenses.

#### General And Administrative Expenses
- General & Administrative (G&A) Expense are the overhead costs of a business, many of which are fixed or semi-fixed. These costs don’t relate directly to selling products or services but rather to the general ongoing operation of the business.
- The most common examples are rent, insurance, utilities, supplies, and expenses related to company management, such as salaries of executives, admin staff, and non-salespeople.

### R&D
- Research and development (R&D) includes activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. It is often the first stage in the development process.
- R&D is separate from most operational activities performed by a corporation. The research and/or development is typically not performed with the expectation of immediate profit. Instead, it is expected to contribute to the long-term profitability of a company. R&D may lead to patents, copyrights, and trademarks as discoveries are made and products created.

### EBITDA
- EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization and is a metric used to evaluate a company’s operating performance. It can be seen as a proxy for cash flow from the entire company’s operations.
- **EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization**
- **EBITDA = Operating Profit + Depreciation + Amortization**
- This metric also excludes expenses associated with debt by adding back interest expense and taxes to earnings. Nonetheless, it is a more precise measure of corporate performance since it is able to show earnings before the influence of accounting and financial deductions.

### Depreciation and Amortization
- Depreciation and amortization (D&A) depend on the historical investments the company has made and not on the current operating performance of the business. Companies invest in long-term fixed assets (such as buildings or vehicles) that lose value due to wear and tear. The depreciation expense is based on a portion of the company’s tangible fixed assets deteriorating. Amortization expense is incurred if the asset is intangible. Intangible assets such as patents are amortized because they have a limited useful life (competitive protection) before expiration.

#### Depreciation
#### Amortization

### EBIT
Operating Income (or EBIT)

### Interest Expense

### Other Expenses

### EBT
EBT (Pre-Tax Income)

### Income Taxes

### Net Income
- **This is the amount that flows into retained earnings on the balance sheet, after deductions for any dividends.**

## Metrics for valuing a company

### EPS (Earnings Per Share)

#### Earnings per share (EPS) is a company's net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding.
#### EPS Excluding Extraordinary Items: 
Imagine a company that owns two factories that make cell phone screens. The land on which one of the factories sits has become very valuable as new developments have surrounded it over the last few years. The company’s management team decides to sell the factory and build another one on less valuable land. This transaction creates a windfall profit for the firm.

While this land sale has created real profits for the company and its shareholders, it is considered an “extraordinary item” because there is no reason to believe the company can repeat that transaction in the future. Shareholders might be misled if the windfall is included in the numerator of the EPS equation, so it is excluded.

### Debt Ratio
The debt ratio compares a company’s total debt to total assets to determine the level of leverage of a company. It shows the portion of the company’s capital that is financed using borrowed funds. The lower the percentage, the less leverage a company has, and the stronger its equity position.

A high percentage shows that the company has high leverage, which increases its default risk. A debt to total asset ratio of 1.0 means the company has a negative net worth and is at a higher risk of default.
