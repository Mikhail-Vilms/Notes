## Balance Sheet

### [Current Assets](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/in/resources/accountants-and-bookkeepers-accountants-and-bookkeepers/what-are-current-assets/)
Short-term economic resources that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. Current assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and various prepaid expenses
- **Cash And Cash Equivalents (CCE)**
- **Accounts Receivable**: Refers to money that customers owe the company, perhaps including an allowance for doubtful accounts since a certain proportion of customers can be expected not to pay.
- **Stock or Inventory**: Is goods available for sale, valued at the lower of the cost or market price. 
- **Marketable Securities**: Marketable securities are the investments made by the company. These investments are both easily marketable as well as expected to be converted into cash within a year. These include treasury bills, notes, bonds and equity securities.
- **Prepaid Expense (Prepayments)**: Represent the value that has already been paid for, such as insurance, advertising contracts or rent.


### Non-current Assets
(Long-term Assets)
#### PP&E
[Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/ppe-property-plant-equipment/) basically includes any of a company’s long-term, fixed assets. PP&E assets are tangible, identifiable, and expected to generate an economic return for the company for more than one year or one operating cycle (whichever is longer). The account can include machinery, equipment, vehicles, buildings, land, office equipment, and furnishings, among other things. Note that, of all these asset classes, land is one of the only assets that does not depreciate over time. If a company produces machinery (for sale), that machinery is not classified as property, plant, and equipment, but rather is classified as inventory. The same goes for real estate companies that hold buildings and land under their assets. Their office buildings and land are PP&E, but the houses or land they sell are inventory.



### Current Liabilities

#### Accounts Payables
Amounts owed by the company to the suppliers
#### Accrued Expenses
Expences that have not been incurred but not yet paid

### Non-Current Liabilities (Long-term Liabilities) (Long-term Debts)
A non-current liability refers to the financial obligations in a company’s balance sheet that are not expected to be paid within one year. Non-current liabilities are due in the long term, compared to short-term liabilities, which are due within one year.

#### Credit lines
A credit line is an arrangement between a lender and a borrower, where the lender makes a specific amount of funds available for the business when needed. Instead of getting lump-sum credit, the business draws a specific amount of credit when needed up to the credit limit allowed by the lender.

A credit line is usually valid for a specified period of time when the business can draw the funds. If a business draws funds to purchase industrial equipment, the credit will be classified as a non-current liability.

#### Long-term lease
Lease payments are common expenditures that companies are required to meet to fulfill their purchase commitments. Companies use capital leases to finance the purchase of fixed assets, such as industrial equipment and motor vehicles.

If the lease term exceeds one year, the lease payments made towards the capital lease are treated as non-current liabilities since they reduce the long-term obligations of the lease. The property purchased using the capital lease is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.

#### Bonds payable
A bond is a long-term lending arrangement between a lender and a borrower, and it is used as a means of financing capital projects. Bonds are issued through an investment bank, and they are classified as long-term liabilities if the payment period exceeds one year. The borrower must make interest payments at fixed amounts over an agreed period of time, usually more than one year.

#### Notes payable
A note, also called a promissory note, is a special type of loan arrangement where a borrower makes an unconditional promise to pay back the principal plus interest to the lender. The promissory note is used to finance the purchase of assets such as machinery and buildings. If the maturity period of the note exceeds one year, it is considered a non-current asset.

## Metrics for valuing a company / Ratios

### EPS (Earnings Per Share)

#### Earnings per share (EPS) is a company's net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding.
#### EPS Excluding Extraordinary Items: 
Imagine a company that owns two factories that make cell phone screens. The land on which one of the factories sits has become very valuable as new developments have surrounded it over the last few years. The company’s management team decides to sell the factory and build another one on less valuable land. This transaction creates a windfall profit for the firm.

While this land sale has created real profits for the company and its shareholders, it is considered an “extraordinary item” because there is no reason to believe the company can repeat that transaction in the future. Shareholders might be misled if the windfall is included in the numerator of the EPS equation, so it is excluded.

### Debt Ratio
The debt ratio compares a company’s total debt to total assets to determine the level of leverage of a company. It shows the portion of the company’s capital that is financed using borrowed funds. The lower the percentage, the less leverage a company has, and the stronger its equity position.

A high percentage shows that the company has high leverage, which increases its default risk. A debt to total asset ratio of 1.0 means the company has a negative net worth and is at a higher risk of default.
